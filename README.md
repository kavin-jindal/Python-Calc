# Python-Calc
Python Calc is my first program on which I have been working from the past month. It is the same like other calculators but is effective and can be used without any error. 

# Features

It will be containing the basic operations:

--> Add
--> Subtract
--> divide
--> Multiply

I have even added some extra operations which can help you like:

--> Square root
--> cube root
--> Square
--> Cube

# Updates

In the next update, these new features will be added.
